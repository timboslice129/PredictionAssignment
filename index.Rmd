### Prediction Assignment   


```{r message=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
```
# Loading our data

```{r}
training <- read.csv("C:/Users/weygang/Downloads/pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("C:/Users/weygang/Downloads/pml-testing.csv")
```

# Cleaning Data

First we decided to deal with NAs by removing columns with NA values. This is because 
many predictors were missing values and we want to keep all observations in the datasets.

```{r}
col.na <- colSums(sapply(training,is.na))
col.na.test <- colSums(sapply(testing, is.na))
training1 <- training[,col.na == 0 & col.na.test==0] # We subset for 0 Nas in both testing and training so that the predictors of both datasets match
testing1 <- testing[,col.na == 0 & col.na.test ==0]
dim(training1)
dim(testing1)
```

After removing our columns with NAs we are left with 60 columns in our testing and training datasets

#dropping variables like name and user_id which are unlikely to be predictors:
```{r}
training2 <- select(training1, -c(user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2,cvtd_timestamp, new_window, X))
testing2 <- select(testing1, -c(problem_id, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2,cvtd_timestamp, new_window, X))
```

Due to the high accuracy that is required to correctly predict all 20 test cases correctly (.995 accuracy for .9 probability)
it was decided that a random forrest model would be appropriate as it generally achieves high accuracy. However cross validation is required to ensure that we don't overfit the model and have a high out of sample error rate.


Random forrests are not computationally efficient and we ran into problems on the large datasets.

To deal with this we configered parallel processing as described in Len Greskis tutorial https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/pml-randomForestPerformance.md

# configuring parallel processing
```{r message=FALSE}
library(parallel)
library(doParallel)
cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1) # convention to leave 1 core for OS
registerDoParallel(cluster)
```

#Configure trainControl object
# We are using k fold cross validation instead of bootstrapping and reducing samples from 25 to 5. 
```{r }
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",
                          number = 5,
                          allowParallel = TRUE)
```

# Building Random Forrest Model
```{r cache=TRUE}
fit <- train(classe ~ ., method="rf", data=training2)
```

# Analysing model fit
```{r}
fit
fit$finalModel
plot(fit, main="Accuracy by Predictor Count")
```

Note that the final model selected by the random forrest algorithm uses 27 predictors returning an accuracy of 0.997 with an Out of Bag (OOB) error of 0.13%. Note that the OOB error rate is equivalent to the out of sample error we would calculate on a holdout dataset using a confusion matrix. Therefore cross validation using a test dataset is not required. 

# Predicting test data

Our model appears to be highly accurate and have a very low out of sample error rate so we are ready to predict the exercise classes of our test cases:

```{r}
data.frame(predict(fit,newdata = testing2))
```
